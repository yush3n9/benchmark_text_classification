# nn-classifier
A classifier based on neutral network which embeds pre trained word2vec model. As dataset I use the public 20 newsgroups. The programme demonstrates the common workflow to build a NN classifier
* Fetch dataset
* Preprocessing, Tokenization etc.
* Vectorization with word2vec
* Prepare train and test dataset
* Build NN model with keras
* Training
* Evaluation

## Setup Instructions:
* virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3
* source venv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt
